# Images Directory

This folder contains visual materials generated during the analysis and modeling stages of the **Customer Account Dormancy Prediction** project.

The images serve as supporting evidence for model evaluation, methodological clarity, and report documentation.

---

## Contents

The visuals included in this directory fall into three primary categories:

### 1. Model Evaluation Plots

These images illustrate the predictive performance of the machine learning models.

Examples include:

- ROC Curve showing classification capability
- Precision-Recall Curve highlighting performance under class imbalance
  
These plots were generated using the test dataset and reflect out-of-sample model performance.

---

### 2. Methodology Diagrams

These diagrams explain the analytical workflow and feature engineering process.

They include:

- End-to-end data processing pipeline
- Temporal feature construction timeline
- Analytical pipeline overview
- Model training workflow overview

Such visuals are intended to clarify methodological decisions and demonstrate the absence of data leakage.

---
## Generation Details

All images were produced using Python visualization libraries, primarily:

- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

The plots reflect reproducible outputs generated from the project notebooks.
